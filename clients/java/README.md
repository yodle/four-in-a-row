###Think you got what it takes?
If you are a Java developer looking for a fun challenge, try the Yodle Four-in-a-Row Challenge! This code is a skeleton written in Java that is already configured to interface with our API, so you can get right down to writing your custom AI and see if you can beat ours.

###Awesome!  How do I use it?
After cloning, simply create a new project from existing sources in your IDE of choice and you should be good to go! (We've included the two .jars you'll need right in the project.)

###Write your AI
Your task is to implement the "play()" method in Player.java, which returns an integer corresponding to the column where you want to make your next move (from left to right, starting with 0). Feel free to modify or add any helper functions in the Board class that may be useful to you when writing your AI.

#See if you can beat us!
To test your AI against ours, choose your AI level (we recommend starting at Level 1 and working your way up) and enter your name into the static fields in C4JavaHarness.java. Then run the main method, which is also in that class.

###Questions?
If you have any questions, please send them over to me at npizzoferrato@yodle.com.  Enjoy!
